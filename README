NAME 

Apache::Clean - interface into HTML::Clean for mod_perl 2.0

SYNOPSIS

httpd.conf:

  PerlModule Apache::Clean

  Alias /clean /usr/local/apache2/htdocs
  <Location /clean>
    PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::Clean

    PerlSetVar CleanOption shortertags
    PerlAddVar CleanOption whitespace
  </Location>

DESCRIPTION

Apache::Clean uses HTML::Clean to tidy up large, messy HTML, saving
bandwidth. 

Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
others are passed through unaltered.

For more information, see

  http://www.perl.com/pub/a/2003/04/17/filters.html

OPTIONS

Apache::Clean supports few options - all of which are based on
options from HTML::Clean.  Apache::Clean will only tidy up whitespace 
(via $h->strip) and will not perform other options of HTML::Clean
(such as browser compatibility).  See the HTML::Clean manpage for 
details.

CleanLevel

sets the clean level, which is passed to the level() method
in HTML::Clean.

  PerlSetVar CleanLevel 9

CleanLevel defaults to 1.

CleanOption

specifies the set of options which are passed to the options()
method in HTML::Clean - see the HTML::Clean manpage for a complete
list of options.

  PerlSetVar CleanOption shortertags
  PerlAddVar CleanOption whitespace

CleanOption has no default.

NOTES

This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
platforms or environments.

FEATURES/BUGS

probably lots - this is the preliminary port to mod_perl 2.0
