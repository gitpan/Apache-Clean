NAME 

Apache::Clean - mod_perl interface into HTML::Clean

SYNOPSIS

httpd.conf:

 PerlModule Apache::Clean

 <Location /clean>
    PerlOutputFilterHandler Apache::Clean

    PerlSetVar  CleanLevel 3

    PerlSetVar  CleanOption shortertags
    PerlAddVar  CleanOption whitespace
 </Location>  

DESCRIPTION

Apache::Clean uses HTML::Clean to tidy up large, messy HTML, saving
bandwidth.  It is particularly useful with Apache::Compress for 
ultimate savings.

Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
others are passed through unaltered.

OPTIONS

Apache::Clean supports few options, most of which are based on
options from HTML::Clean.  Apache::Clean will only tidy up whitespace 
(via $h->strip) and will not perform other options of HTML::Clean
(such as browser compatibility).  See the HTML::Clean manpage for 
details.

CleanLevel

sets the clean level, which is passed to the level() method
in HTML::Clean.

  PerlSetVar CleanLevel 9

CleanLevel defaults to 3.

CleanOption

specifies the set of options which are passed to the options()
method in HTML::Clean.

  PerlAddVar CleanOption shortertags
  PerlSetVar CleanOption whitespace

CleanOption has do default.

NOTES

This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
platforms or environments.

FEATURES/BUGS

probably lots - this is the preliminary port to mod_perl 2.0
