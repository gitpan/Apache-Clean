NAME 

Apache::Clean - Clean up HTML 

SYNOPSIS

httpd.conf:

 <Location /someplace>
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Clean

    PerlSetVar  Level 3
 </Location>  

Apache::Clean is Filter aware, meaning that it can be used within
Apache::Filter framework without modification.  Just include the
directive
  
  PerlSetVar Filter On

and modify the PerlHandler directive accordingly...

DESCRIPTION

Apache::Clean uses HTML::Clean to tidy up large, messy HTML, saving
bandwidth.  It is particularly useful with Apache::Compress for 
ultimate savings.

The only current configuration directive is Level, which defaults
to 3.  Apache::Clean will only tidy up whitespace (via $h->strip) and
will not perform other options of HTML::Clean (such as browser
compatibility).  See the HTML::Clean manpage for details.

Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
others are passed through unaltered.

NOTES

Verbose debugging is enabled by setting $Apache::Clean::DEBUG=1
or greater.  To turn off all debug information, set your apache
LogLevel directive above info level.

This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
platforms or environments.  It requires PERL_LOG_API=1, 
PERL_FILE_API=1, and maybe other hooks to function properly.

FEATURES/BUGS

  No unknown bugs or features at this time...
