NAME 

Apache::Clean - mod_perl interface into HTML::Clean

SYNOPSIS

httpd.conf:

 PerlModule Apache::Clean

 <Location /clean>
    SetHandler perl-script
    PerlHandler Apache::Clean

    PerlSetVar  CleanLevel 3

    PerlSetVar  CleanOption shortertags
    PerlAddVar  CleanOption whitespace

    PerlSetVar  CleanCache On
 </Location>  

Apache::Clean is Filter aware, meaning that it can be used within
Apache::Filter framework without modification.  Just include the
directives

  PerlModule Apache::Filter
  PerlSetVar Filter On

and modify the PerlHandler directive accordingly...

DESCRIPTION

Apache::Clean uses HTML::Clean to tidy up large, messy HTML, saving
bandwidth.  It is particularly useful with Apache::Compress for 
ultimate savings.

Only documents with a content type of "text/html" are affected - all
others are passed through unaltered.

OPTIONS

Apache::Clean supports few options, most of which are based on
options from HTML::Clean.  Apache::Clean will only tidy up whitespace 
(via $h->strip) and will not perform other options of HTML::Clean
(such as browser compatibility).  See the HTML::Clean manpage for 
details.

* CleanLevel

sets the clean level, which is passed to the level() method
in HTML::Clean.

  PerlSetVar CleanLevel 9

CleanLevel defaults to 3.

* CleanOption

specifies the set of options which are passed to the options()
method in HTML::Clean.

  PerlAddVar CleanOption shortertags
  PerlSetVar CleanOption whitespace

CleanOption has do default.

* CleanCache

sets the behavior of Apache::Clean in regards to proper
cache header behavior.  this option is only meaningful
when Apache::Clean is _not_ part of an Apache::Filter
chain.

mainly, CleanCache On enables Apache::Clean to
set the Last-Modified, Content-Length, and Etag headers,
as well as allowing it do decide whether a 304 response
is allowed.  See recipe 6.6 in the mod_perl Developer's
Cookbook for a more detailed discussion on handling
conditional and cache-based headers - the code is
practically identical to what you will find there.

The basic idea here is that although Apache::Clean is
dynamically manipulating the content of the requested
resource, the meaning of the document has not changed
just because <strong> was changed to <b>.  If you
disagree with this assessment you can set CleanCache to
Off.

CleanCache defaults to On.

NOTES

Verbose debugging is enabled by setting $Apache::Clean::DEBUG=1
or greater.  To turn off all debug information, set your apache
LogLevel directive above info level.

This is alpha software, and as such has not been tested on multiple
platforms or environments.  It requires PERL_LOG_API=1, 
PERL_FILE_API=1, and maybe other hooks to function properly.

FEATURES/BUGS

No known bugs or features at this time...
