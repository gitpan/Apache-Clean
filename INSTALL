INSTALLATION:

this module follows the standard 

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

routine.

if you want to run the tests, you'll need to do
something similar to the following

  $ export APACHE=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd
  $ export APXS=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
  $ make test

whether you choose to specify httpd or apxs depends on
whether or not your installation is has mod_so, so you may need
one or the other or both.

you can also configure the test suite when building the Makefile

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

run 

  $ t/TEST -help 

or see the README in the Apache::Test distribtion for more options

of course, this module is made to run under Apache 2.0
and mod_perl 2.0 so you'll need those as well.  perl 5.8.0
is also a good idea.

have fun.
