NOTE: 

  you MUST use the current mod_perl 2.0 CVS sources for this
  module to work as expected.  even then, it might not work.
  the most recent CPAN release (1.99_08) and RedHat releases
  most definitely will not work.

  in general, you can get the recent CVS sources via

    $ cvs -d":pserver:anoncvs@cvs.apache.org:/home/cvspublic" checkout modperl-2.0

  see 

    http://perl.apache.org/contribute/cvs_howto.html

  for detailed instructions on how to use apache.org's anonymous CVS 

  you can also get a recent CVS snapshot at

    http://cvs.apache.org/snapshots/modperl-2.0/


INSTALLATION:

this module follows the standard 

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

routine.

if you want to run the tests, you'll need to do
something similar to the following

  $ export APACHE=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd
  $ export APXS=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
  $ make test

whether you choose to specify httpd or apxs depends on
whether or not your installation is has mod_so, so you may need
one or the other or both.

you can also configure the test suite when building the Makefile

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

run 

  $ t/TEST -help 

or see the README in the Apache::Test distribtion for more options

of course, this module is made to run under Apache 2.0
and mod_perl 2.0 so you'll need those as well,
preferably recent copies complied from CVS.  Perl 5.8.0
is also a good idea.
