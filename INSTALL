this module follows standard 

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ su
  # make install

routine.

if you want to run the tests, you'll need to do
something similar to the following

  $ export APACHE=/usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd
  $ export APXS=/usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs
  $ make test

you can also configure the test suite when building the Makefile

  $ perl Makefile.PL -apxs /usr/local/apache2/bin/apxs

of course, this is made to run under Apache 2.0
and mod_perl 2.0, so you'll need those as well,
preferably recent copies complied from CVS.  Perl 5.8.0
is also a good idea.
